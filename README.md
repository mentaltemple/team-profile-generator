## Motivation

The motivation behind this project was to create a functional and practical command-line application utilizing a combination all of the technologies I have learned so far: html, css, javascript and node.js. Through this process, I have gained a deeper understanding of command-line application building, node modules, dependencies (inquirerer, jest, path, fs), constructor functions & classes, and testing. With this application you can easily generate a nice looking web-page based on a few simple user inputs.

## Installation

1. Open terminal
2. Navigate to ./team-profile-generator
3. Invoke the application with the following command:

```bash
node index.js
```

## Usage

Demonstration Video: https://drive.google.com/file/d/17uAxs_7u2cqwjQ2vGe0hQtam8HAYCvRs/view

Once you've run the file from the terminal, you will be presented with a series of questions about your employees. Simply answer all of the questions and a webpage will be generated including all of the info received.
